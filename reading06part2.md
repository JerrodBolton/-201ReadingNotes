## Domain Modeling

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

## Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)

- A table represents information in a grid format.
  Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
  schedules, and sports results.

- The **_table_** element is used to create a table. This is to start the table off and put everything in motion.

- (The tr stands for table row.)

- (The th stands for table heading.)

### Long Tables

    - ***thead*** The headings of the table should

sit inside the **_thead_** element.

    - The body should sit inside the

**_tbody_** element.

    - The footer belongs inside the

**_tfoot_** element.

### Summary table

- The **_table_** element is used to add tables to a web
  page.

- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
  with the **_tr_** element.

- Inside each row there are a number of cells
  represented by the **_td_** element (or **_th_** if it is a
  header).

- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
  or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

- For long tables you can split the table into a **_thead_**,
  **_tbody_**, and **_tfoot_**.

## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)
