to group together sections of a page.

specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
