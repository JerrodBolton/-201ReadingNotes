# Read: 13a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## Transforms Heading

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.

### 2D Scale

Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.

The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
