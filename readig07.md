# HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)

## Layout for CSS

- In this chapter we are going to to look at the how to control where
  every element and where it site on the website

      - this is so that I can change the layout of the web page.

### position: static

        - Elements don't have a specified a width in the CSS.

        -  You then use the offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) to indicate how far to move the element from where it would have been in normal flow.

#### Summary that layout have went over.

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements
  to group together sections of a page.

- X Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
  specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

- X The float property moves content to the left or right
  of the page and can be used to create multi-column
  layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

- X Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

- X Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
  and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
  pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

- X Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

- X CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

- X You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
